Put SSH keys into this directory for `git` and other
tools to work (refer to OpenSSH or Git documentation
on how to set up SSH-based authentication). This is
needed for Docker-based Serge installations only.

You don't have to set up permissions for the files here:
the `boot/bootstrap.sh` script will take care of this.
